# DVD-Audio docs.
Creating DVD-Audio discs is harder than I thought.

## DVD-Video and other DVD formats.
DVD is a very complicated physical-media format. The most common iteration of this disc is DVD-Video, you should 100% have a DVD-Video disc in your house from an old movie or something like that. Other common iteration is DVD-Data, which uses a DVD disc as a data storage container, like a USB. Other common one is DVD-ROM which can be found in installation discs such as Windows 7 DVD. Then you have the weird ones like DVD-RAM and DVD-Audio.

## DVD-Audio is weird.
Oh yeah, this is a very, very weird and not common format. You see, at the time DVD was born, Audio CDs existed, not only that, but SACDs existed too, so there was no need of making DVD-Audio discs... and they still existed. Now, there's almost no docmunentation about how to make DVD-Audio discs nowadays, so it was hard for me to try this personal project with no docs.

## Why would I want a DVD-Audio disc.
You have actually plenty of reasons for this. Audio CDs can handle only 16-bit/44.1kHz (sometimes 48kHz) as maximum quality. If you want to make a physical audio disc containing Hi-Res audio on it, you are limited to Blu-Ray Audio discs and DVD-Audio discs, and since Blu-Ray is expensive as fuck, DVD may be your only option. Now I know there's SACD, but not only there are no blank SACD discs, they contain DSD streams which is more difficult to even find. Now, DVD-Audio discs can handle Hi-Res audio up to 24-bit/192kHz.

## The serious bussiness.
Now let's begin this journey. DVD has two sections: VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS.
